# WeatherAppTask

First of all registered the app and got the api key from openWeatherAPI. Xcode Project contains three Viewcontrollers. MainVC, Task1VC and Task2VC. MainVC is the initial VC from which we navigate. Task1VC conatins functionality related to step1. Task2VC conatins functionality related to step2. Wrote Unit test for response from API. Used MVVM Architecture for this project to manage the code properly
